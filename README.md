<h1>Sign Language Recognition</h1>

**What steps you have to follow??**

1. Download or clone my Repository to your device.
2. type `pip install -r requirments.txt` in command prompt(this will install required package for project).
3. If you get error from pip install -r requirments.txt then you have manually download every library. for that write these following commands in your command prompt:

`pip install opencv-python`

`pip install mediapipe`

`pip install scikit-learn`

`pip install tensorflow`

`pip install argparse`

`pip install collections`

`pip install numpy`

`pip install itertools`

`pip install typing`

`pip install pyautogui`

`pip install mediapipe`

`pip install dotenv`

4. You can check all the list of these library that you install my writing `pip list` on your command prompt.
5. After you meet the requirnments click on `main.py` flie and run it.

**Project flow & explaination:**

After meeting requirments just open the `main.py` flie and run it. `This code required your device's camera to run this program`. and this will start detecting your hand points and by few processing it will tell you that what sign you are tring to make and show this in output section.

    Note : This code will only recognize the sign of your right hand.
